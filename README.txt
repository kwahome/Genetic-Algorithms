Description of the program:
********************************************************

    This program demonstrates basic genetic algorithm with a roulette wheel selection.

    The population is randomly initialized after which selection to determine the fittest parents for the next generation
    is done based on a randomly assigned fitness value.

    Termination is fixed to a maximum iteration of 2000 which can be changed. Its purpose is for faster convergence (for demonstration purpose)

    The program is written in java and has two files. Compile both and run the Population.java which has the main class
